This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl's error handling when dealing with file I/O. The `bug.tcl` file shows an example of incorrect error handling using the `catch` command. The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides the corrected implementation.  The issue highlights the importance of explicitly checking the return value of commands like `open` to ensure robust error handling.
